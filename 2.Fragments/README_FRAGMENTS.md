Besides following the basic tutorial, below changes were added:
+ Simple back behavior has been added:
	When pressing back, current fragment item is decresed by one.
	If user is already on item 0, app closes.
- Toast implementation and behavior have been updated:
	Toast text is now updated immediately after tapping on a new button.
	A unique toast instance is available in MainActivity.
